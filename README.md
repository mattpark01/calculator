This is a good resource to aid your learning of the C programing language.
Each file includes extensive comments to help you understand exactly what is going on.
I never assume you know anything, therefore, I explain top-down and via first-principles,
in areas as necessary. Currently a work in progress. I recommend you copy my code to get a feel,
then try to write it on your own (writing as extensive comments as I did) to slow yourself down
and understand what your doing.
